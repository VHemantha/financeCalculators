These are fixed for the life of the loan."}},
  {"@type":"Question","name":"Should I refinance my federal student loans?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Refinancing federal loans with a private lender can lower your rate but permanently forfeits federal benefits: income-driven repayment plans (IDR), Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), deferment/forbearance, and loan discharge options. Only refinance if you're confident you won't need these protections."}},
  {"@type":"Question","name":"What credit score do I need to refinance student loans?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most private lenders require a credit score of 650+, with the best rates (sub-5%) going to borrowers with 720+ scores. A steady income, low DTI, and graduation from an accredited institution also improve approval odds."}}

Enter your current loan balance and rate, then compare against a potential new rate. The calculator shows your new monthly payment, monthly savings, and total lifetime interest savings. Important: refinancing federal loans with a private lender permanently eliminates access to income-driven repayment, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and federal forbearance — weigh these benefits carefully before refinancing.</p></div>
