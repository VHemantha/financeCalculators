  {"@type":"Question","name":"What credit score do I need for a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 580–640 for personal loan approval. Scores of 720+ qualify for the best rates (6–12% APR). Scores below 580 may still qualify but at much higher rates (25–36%) or may face denial. Income and DTI ratio also significantly affect approval."}},
  {"@type":"Question","name":"What are typical personal loan interest rates in 2025?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Personal loan APRs in 2025 range from about 7–36%, depending on credit score, lender, loan amount, and term. Excellent credit (750+): 7–12%. Good credit (680–749): 12–21%. Fair credit (580–679): 21–36%. Always compare at least 3 lenders."}},
  {"@type":"Question","name":"How does DTI ratio affect personal loan approval?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio) is your total monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income. Most lenders prefer a DTI below 36% for personal loan approval. A DTI above 50% significantly reduces approval odds regardless of credit score."}}

Credit score maps to an industry-average APR range (based on 2025 lender data from LendingTree, NerdWallet, and Bankrate). While not a formal pre-qualification, this tool helps you understand where you stand before submitting a hard inquiry that affects your credit score.</p></div>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What credit score do I need for a personal loan? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">Most lenders require 580+ for approval. 720+ gets the best rates (6–12% APR). 580–679 qualifies but at higher rates (21–36%). Below 580, options are limited to credit unions, secured loans, or peer-to-peer platforms. Credit score is the #1 factor after income verification.</div></div>
      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Does applying for a personal loan hurt my credit score? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">Yes — a formal application triggers a hard inquiry, temporarily reducing your score by 5–10 points. However, most lenders offer soft-inquiry pre-qualification checks that don't affect your score. Rate shopping within a 14–45 day window counts as a single inquiry under FICO and VantageScore models.</div></div>
      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Personal loan vs credit card — which is better for debt consolidation? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">Personal loans have lower fixed APRs (for good credit), fixed monthly payments, and a clear payoff date — ideal for consolidation. Credit cards have variable rates and no forced payoff timeline. For $5,000+ in high-APR credit card debt, consolidating to a personal loan at a lower fixed rate almost always saves money.</div></div>
