Using the 4% rule: if you spend $50,000/year, your FIRE number is $50,000 ÷ 0.04 = $1,250,000."}},
  {"@type":"Question","name":"Is the 4% rule still valid in 2025?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The 4% rule (based on the Trinity Study) was derived for 30-year retirements. For early retirement (40+ year horizon), many experts suggest a 3–3.5% withdrawal rate for higher safety margins. The rule remains a useful starting point but should be adjusted for your specific situation."}},
  {"@type":"Question","name":"What are the different types of FIRE?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"LeanFIRE: retire on $25,000–$40,000/year (minimal lifestyle). Regular FIRE: $40,000–$100,000/year. FatFIRE: $100,000+/year (comfortable lifestyle). BaristaFIRE: semi-retire with part-time work. CoastFIRE: stop saving and let existing investments grow to FIRE number."}}

    <div class="calc-intro"><p>The FIRE calculator computes your Financial Independence number — the portfolio size at which you can retire and live off investment returns indefinitely. Based on the famous "4% Rule" from the Trinity Study (1998), you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio annually with a historically high probability of the money lasting 30+ years. Enter your desired annual retirement spending, current savings, and annual savings rate to find how many years until you reach financial independence.</p></div>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What is the 4% rule and is it safe? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">The 4% rule (from the 1998 Trinity Study) found that a 4% annual withdrawal from a 50/50 stock-bond portfolio survived 30-year historical retirement periods with 95%+ success. For 40+ year early retirements, consider a 3–3.5% rate. It's a planning guideline, not a guarantee.</div></div>
      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What is a good savings rate to reach FIRE? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">Your time to FIRE is largely determined by your savings rate (savings ÷ income). Save 50% → retire in ~17 years. Save 70% → retire in ~9 years. Save 25% → retire in ~32 years. Maximizing your savings rate — by increasing income or reducing expenses — dramatically accelerates FIRE.</div></div>
      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What are CoastFIRE and BaristaFIRE? <span class="faq-icon">+</span></button><div class="faq-answer">CoastFIRE: stop adding to investments and let compound growth reach your FIRE number by a target age. BaristaFIRE: semi-retire to a part-time job that covers living expenses while your portfolio grows. Both reduce the required FIRE number and accelerate your timeline.</div></div>
